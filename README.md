# ECE-128-Lab-6-Latch-Flip-flip-Clock-Divider-Switch-Debouncer
The purpose of this lab is to design and implement several components used in digital systems. These include constructing an SR latch using either NAND or NOR gate and an SR flip-flop, followed by a design of a positive-edge triggered D flip-flop incorporating both synchronous and asynchronous reset. Additionally, a positive-edge triggered T flip-flop is developed and utilized to create a 3-bit counter. Furthermore the implementation of a 25 MHz clock divider and a switch debouncer to understand a creation of a stable and reliable input signal behavior for digital circuits.
